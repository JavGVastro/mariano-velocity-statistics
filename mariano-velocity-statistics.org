* Coherence scales in H II regions

** Plan
+ Derive velocity structure functions for H II regions of different sizes:
  + Lagoon, Carina, Tarantula
+ Compare 

** Velocity maps of Carina and Lagoon

+ Gaia-ESO spectroscopy
  + Damiano:2016a Carina
    + 10 arcmin at 2.3 kpc = 6 pc
    + 10 arcsec = 0.1 pc
    + Can analyze blue and red components separately and together
  + Damiano:2017b Lagoon
    + D = 1250 pc
    + Total extent: 0.8 deg = 17 pc
+ MUSE spectroscopy
  + McLeod:2016a Carina
    + 2 arcmin at 2.3 kpc = 1.3 pc
    + 1 arcsec = 0.01 pc
  + Mc-Leod:2016a Orion
    + 5 arcmin at 410 pc = 0.6 pc
    + 1 arcsec = 0.002 pc
    + Amplitude is about 10 km/s
  + Castro:2018a Tarantula (30 Dor)
    + These are excellent
    + 2 arcmin at 50 kpc = 30 pc
    + 1 arcsec = 0.242 pc
    + Amplitude is about 40 km/s
    + Looks like 5 arcsec is typical fluctuation scale => 1 pc
    + Anti correlation of intensity with \sigma(LOS) - see Fig 7
    + Could use density and de-extincted H\alpha to get LOS thickness
  + McLeod:2015a Eagle pillars
    + A bit too noisy to do much with
+ Longslit spectroscopy
  + Arthur:2016a Orion
    + Find scale of 0.05 pc decorrelation scale from struc func
    + Similar scale from power spectrum of brightness
    + Inner scale of 0.02 pc, but not clear what this is
** Other literature on Lagoon kinematics
+ Also see the images in introduction to my Greece talk
  + [[file:~/Dropbox/Presentations/Olympia2014/wjh-greece-2014.pdf]]
*** Relation to molecular/neutral gas
+ Tiwari:2018a have CO, etc for Lagoon region
  + Ionized gas is at negative velocities with respect to CO
    + Lada:1976a have +11 km/s LSR for CO at biggest clump
  + This is reminiscent of champagne flow, as in Orion
+ Esteban:1999a have multiple optical lines for M42 (Orion), M17 (Eagle), and M8 (Lagoon)
  + For Lagoon
    + Slit is 25 arcsec S of Hourglass
    + V(HEL) approx -2 km/s for low-ionization lines
    + Higher ionization lines are more like -10
    + Discrepant results for [O I] and [N I] but may suffer from sky line contamination
  + They find a velocity-IP correlation in all cases, indicating blue-shifted champagne flows
*** Dominant sources of ionizing radiation
+ Looks like main ionizing star (9 Sgr) is 1pc in front of cloud in Lagoon
  + From Fig 20 of Damiani:2017a
*** Prior art on Lagoon structure function
+ Chakraborty:1999a calculated the [O III] structure function of Hourglass region
  + Separations of 2-30 arcsec (so very little dynamic range)
  + As compared with up to 1800 arcsec in Damiani
  + They did something very strange to eliminate large scale gradients
  + And their absolute values are very large: saturates at 280 km^2/s^2
+ Chakraborty:1997a give [N II] velocity image but do not calculate statistics
  + And they don't even have absolute velocities
*** Previous studies of large scale kinematics
+ Haenel:1987a did FP spectroscopy of the entire nebula and has a grid at 50 arcsec resolution (0.014 deg)
  + 34 x 26 pixels = 0.5 x 0.4 degrees
  + Velocities are LSR
  + Seems to agree more or less with Damiani, given the 10 km/s difference between heliocentric and LSR
+ So this is very similar number of points to the Damiani data, but coverage is more uniform


** Stage 1 of Mariano project

*** DONE Download the Gaia-ESO datasets
CLOSED: [2018-09-25 Tue 08:41]
+ Damiani Carina
  + [[file:data/J_A+A_591_A74_table1.dat.fits]]
+ Damiani Lagoon
  + [[file:data/J_A+A_604_A135_table2.dat.fits]]

*** DONE Initial look at Carina data by Will
CLOSED: [2018-09-25 Tue 10:25]
See
 + Jupyter notebook: [[file:mariano-test.ipynb]]
 + Pure python version: [[file:mariano-test.py]]

*** TODO Initial look at Lagoon data by Mariano
+ [ ] Install required packages
+ [ ] Load data with astropy
+ [ ] Convert to pandas
+ [ ] Clean up data as necessary
+ [ ] Look at correlations
+ [ ] Make maps
+ [ ] Calculate structure functions


** Further stages
*** Obtain more data
**** MUSE data on Carina
+ McLeod:2016a best region is around "defiant finger", just to W of Keyhole.
  + That is the brightest region, and only one that overlaps the Gaia-ESO observations
  + Other regions are fainter and are in the periphery of the nebula
+ As well as the published McLeod:2016a stuff, there are new observations of the Tr14 region, which are available from the data archive
+ There is a python package for working with MUSE data: ~mpdaf~, which might or might not be useful
  + There is the option of working with /pixel tables/, which have not been resampled
  + This might help avoid some of the artefacts seen in the velocity maps
**** MUSE data on 30 Dor
*** Larger scale patterns in Orion 
+ Haenel:1987a have maps at arcmin scale for whole nebula
+ [ ] Could extend velocity statistics for Orion by combining this with the Arthur:2016a Garcia-Diaz:2008a data
*** Extragalactic HII regions
+ Look at data like in Moiseev:20015a
